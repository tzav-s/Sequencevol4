Implement the corresponding functions in C language of the following mathematical definitions:
• The maximum common divisor (gdc) of two non-negative integers is given by the following retrospective
definition:
gcd (a, b) = c
a, if b = 0
gcd (b, a% b), otherwise}
• Two integers are said to be relatively prime (coprime) if their maximum common divisor is
1.
Functions - Procedures - page 10 of 11
• The function φ of Euler (phi) of a positive integer N is the number of positive integers
numbers less than or equal to N, which are relatively prime to N (ie integers K with 1
<= Κ <= Ν).
Implement a program in C, which asks the user for an integer X and displays its values
Euler function φ from 1 to the number X. Assume that the user always gives a number
greater than or equal to 1 - no test required. The display of messages will be done through the main
program (main () function, ie the command to display messages (printf) will be in
main ()).
